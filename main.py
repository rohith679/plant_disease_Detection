    Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! 🌿🔍

    Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

    ### About Us
    Learn more about the project, our team, and our goals on the **About** page.

    ### Diseases We Can Detect
    Our model is trained to detect various plant diseases, including but not limited to:
    - **Apple Diseases:** Apple Scab, Black Rot, Cedar Apple Rust, Healthy
    - **Corn Diseases:** Cercospora Leaf Spot, Common Rust, Northern Leaf Blight, Healthy
    - **Tomato Diseases:** Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, Septoria Leaf Spot, Spider Mites (Two-spotted Spider Mite), Target Spot, Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, Tomato Mosaic Virus, Healthy
    - **Potato Diseases:** Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy
    - **Grape Diseases:** Black Rot, Esca (Black Measles), Leaf Blight (Isariopsis Leaf Spot), Healthy
    - **Peach Diseases:** Bacterial Spot, Healthy
    - **Strawberry Diseases:** Leaf Scorch, Healthy
    - **Pepper Diseases:** Bacterial Spot, Healthy
    - **Blueberry Diseases:** Healthy
    - **Soybean Diseases:** Healthy
    - **Raspberry Diseases:** Healthy
    - **Squash Diseases:** Powdery Mildew, Healthy
